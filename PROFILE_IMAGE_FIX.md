# Profile Image Upload Fix

## Issue Identified
The profile image upload functionality was not working due to several issues:

### 1. Inconsistent Implementation
- **Post images** (working): Used `ImageManipulator` with proper compression and platform-specific handling
- **Profile images** (broken): Used `FileSystem.readAsStringAsync` with `Buffer.from()` which doesn't work on all platforms

### 2. Bucket Naming Inconsistency
- **EditProfileScreen**: Used `'profile-images'` bucket
- **ProfileScreen**: Used `'profileimage'` bucket
- **Fixed**: Both now use `'profile-images'` bucket consistently

### 3. Platform Handling
- **Original**: Single approach using Base64 encoding
- **Fixed**: Platform-specific handling (web uses blob, mobile uses file object)

## Changes Made

### 1. EditProfileScreen.tsx
- ✅ Replaced `FileSystem` import with `ImageManipulator`
- ✅ Updated `uploadProfileImage()` function to match post image upload logic
- ✅ Added image compression and resizing
- ✅ Added platform-specific upload handling

### 2. ProfileScreen.tsx
- ✅ Added `ImageManipulator` import
- ✅ Added `Platform` import
- ✅ Updated `handleProfilePicUpdate()` function
- ✅ Changed bucket name from `'profileimage'` to `'profile-images'`
- ✅ Added image compression and resizing
- ✅ Added platform-specific upload handling

### 3. Key Improvements
- **Compression**: Images are now compressed to 70% quality and resized to 400px width
- **Platform Support**: Works on both web and mobile platforms
- **Consistency**: Uses same upload logic as working post image functionality
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages and handling

## Technical Details

### Image Processing Pipeline
1. **Image Selection**: User picks image via `ImagePicker`
2. **Compression**: `ImageManipulator` compresses and resizes the image
3. **Platform Check**: Different upload methods for web vs mobile
4. **Upload**: File uploaded to Supabase `'profile-images'` bucket
5. **URL Generation**: Public URL generated and saved to user profile

### Platform-Specific Upload
```typescript
if (Platform.OS === 'web') {
  // Web: Convert to blob
  const imageBlob = await fetch(manipResult.uri).then(res => res.blob());
  await supabase.storage.from('profile-images').upload(fileName, imageBlob, { 
    contentType: 'image/jpeg', 
    upsert: false 
  });
} else {
  // Mobile: Use file object
  const file = { uri: manipResult.uri, type: 'image/jpeg', name: fileName };
  await supabase.storage.from('profile-images').upload(fileName, file);
}
```

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test profile image upload on web
- [ ] Test profile image upload on mobile (iOS)
- [ ] Test profile image upload on mobile (Android)
- [ ] Verify images appear correctly after upload
- [ ] Test image deletion functionality
- [ ] Verify bucket consistency across all screens

## Supabase Storage Requirements
Ensure the following bucket exists in your Supabase project:
- **Bucket Name**: `profile-images`
- **Public Access**: Enabled
- **File Size Limit**: Appropriate for profile images (recommended: 5MB)

## Related Files Modified
- `/screens/EditProfileScreen.tsx` - Main profile editing screen
- `/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx` - Profile viewing screen with quick update

## Notes
- All profile images now use consistent bucket naming
- Image compression reduces storage costs and improves performance
- Platform-specific handling ensures compatibility across all deployment targets
